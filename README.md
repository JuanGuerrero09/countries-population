# Who has more? (Countries edition)
Hi! this is a game based in the popular [Higher or Lower](http://www.higherlowergame.com) for geography fans (like me)
## How it works?
This game consists of choosing whether one country has more or less pupulation or territory than the other.
## How it was made?
The stack for this project consisted in: 
- Vanilla Javascript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
And the projest use the [Rest Countries API] (https://restcountries.com/)
## Future Features
I'm planning to add the following features to this project:
- [ ] UX/UI Update (Make it more responsive)
- [ ] Add Google Firebase to save the record
- [ ] Add time for the questions

Feel free to contribute c:
